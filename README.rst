django-classifieds
==================

Features include searching, attaching images to ads, PayPal checkout, configurable pricing options, and custom templates for listing, viewing, and editing each category of ads.

This branch will remove the customizable category fields feature. It will hopefully replace it with an easy way to add new category fields specific to each category within the source rather than trying to keep the relevant information in the database.
